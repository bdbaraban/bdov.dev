      I know not what brings you here - perhaps you are a lost acquaintance
      snooping on what I&apos;ve been up to, maybe you are one of the recruiters
      I like to believe will flood this site with the offer-I-can&apos;t-refuse,
      most likely, you a bot trying to scrape some juicy personal data -
      regardless, welcome.
